    The Simulated Profiling Environment for Embodied Intelligence (SPEEN) is an open-source platform for evaluating embodied Large Language Model agents in a simulated game environment.
    As LLMs are increasingly integrated into robotics and embodied systems, SPEEN addresses the critical need for standardized evaluation frameworks by providing a modifiable system for benchmarking and implementing embodied LLM simulations in Godot.
    We implement a proof-of-concept Minecraft-like environment to demonstrate an application of this system, providing both structured quantitative benchmarking through diverse scenarios and an open-world sandbox for qualitative assessment of decision-making behaviors.
    Our approach enables researchers to test various embodied LLM implementations in a flexible simulated environment and contribute to developing robust evaluative measures for Trustworthy AI.

\section{Problem Identification}

\paragraph{Background}
This project originated as a Senior Design Project at UC Davis in collaboration with Justin Jia (affiliated with Apple) to address practical needs in AI testing.
The overarching goal of the project at this stage was to develop a sandbox environment specifically for testing AI programs.

\subsection{Exploratory Research}

\paragraph{Definitions}
We define agentic AI as systems capable of autonomous decision-making and environmental interaction, with embodied AI specifically concerning agents that interact with physical or simulated worlds.

\subsubsection{Focusing on Large Language Models}
Our research identified significant gaps in environmental design for evaluating advanced AI systems.
We examined existing platforms like NeuralMMO, which provides an open-source environment for measuring \textbf{reinforcement learning} algorithm performance in a 2D grid world with complex tasks that emulate a massively multiplayer online game.
A key insight from NeuralMMO's creator Joseph Suarez influenced our approach:
\begin{quote}
    "It is very easy to create an interesting looking simulator. It is very hard, under the constraints of making useful AI research [to create an environment meant for testing and training AI]…it is not just a game, it is an AI simulation."\footnote{Suarez, J. (2024, May 14). Joseph Suarez Thesis Defense - Neural MMO. YouTube. \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwTOFYgtAWg}.}
\end{quote}
Furthermore, despite increasing environmental complexity, advanced algorithms like PPO were observed to be able to effectively solve most tasks given sufficient computation.
This shifted our focus away from reinforcement learning and toward Large Language Models, which have shown recent promise in integration with robotics and embodied systems.

\subsubsection{Environment Design}
There are a number of proposed embodied LLM architectures that use Minecraft as a testing environment.
Projects including NVIDIA's Voyager project (extending from the MineDojo project) and Project Sid by Altera\footnote{AL, A., Ahn, A., Becker, N., Carroll, S., Christie, N., Cortes, M., Demirci, A., Du, M., Li, F., Luo, S., Wang, P. Y., Willows, M., Yang, F., \& Yang, G. R. (2024). Project Sid: Many-agent simulations toward AI civilization. \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00114}.} attempt to provide prompting and training architectures for agents to exist in the game.
However, these projects exhibit several critical limitations as benchmarks for agentic LLMs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lack of Open-Source Availability:}
          Project Sid articulates a way for many-agents to exist within Minecraft, proposing supposedly powerful prompting architectures, but is not open-source.
          The methodology for reproducing their results remains unclear, potentially creating barriers to validation and further scientific progress.
    \item \textbf{Limited Flexibility:}
          While MiniDojo projects like NVIDIA's Voyager\footnote{Wang, G., Xie, Y., Jiang, Y., Mandlekar, A., Xiao, C., Zhu, Y., Fan, L., \& Anandkumar, A. (2023). Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models. \url{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.16291}.} have yielded impressive results and are open-source, we believe there is an increasing need to develop benchmarks that generalize to real-world use cases and to metrics specific to agentic AI rather than Minecraft.
          The domain-specific metrics of area explored \& percentage of available items collected are not necessarily useful for evaluating LLMs in a more general sense or for real-world applications.
\end{itemize}

Additional barriers exist in the choice of environment.
While Minecraft offers inherent complexity and extensive documentation as an additional input to AI training, it presents significant limitations as a benchmark:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It requires a commercial license, creating accessibility barriers
    \item No existing standardized context provisioning or testing metrics
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Chosen Environment} While environments that more closely emulate the real world would better map to real-world robotic applications, we believed that focusing on standardizing an accessible contextualization and prompting system would make our project more useful.
Thus, our primary focus became the development of modifiable prompting architecture---i.e., the interaction between the LLM and the game environment---and the evaluation of agentic LLMs in a equally modular simulated environment.
With this in mind, we designed our environment to simpler and more similar to Minecraft for our proof-of-concept, but we hope that future work will expand our systems to more realistic or complex environments.

\subsubsection{Open-Source}
Our research identified issues in agentic LLM projects being closed source, limiting their utility for broader research purposes.
By building our system to allow for transparent and reproducible integration of new LLMs and prompting architecture, we hope to address these limitations.
This constraint guided our decision to use the Godot game engine, which is open-source and allows for easy modification and expansion.
Our selection of Godot was also motivated by its rapid development trajectory and growing community support, with major improvements in each release enhancing both performance and development workflows, showing great promise for use beyond simply game development.

\subsubsection{Research Use Case}
Ensuring our backend Python websocket supports both cloud-hosted and locally-hosted LLMs is important because this allows researchers to test various models as they're released.
Using abstraction layers, new models can be integrated into the system without requiring significant changes to the code base on the development side.
We implemented several different scenarios that stress test our API and agents capabilities for planning, environmental reasoning, and cooperation.
In the current product, we support the OpenAI GPT models, Google Gemini API, locally-hosted LLMs via OLlamma (Gemma3, Deepseek-r1, etc.).

\subsection{Design Requirements}
Based on our research findings, we had the sufficient justification to develop SPEEN as an open-source benchmarking environment specifically for evaluating embodied AI (LLM) performance.
Listed below were our comprehensive design goals and requirements for the system:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Standardized Evaluation Framework:}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment for embodied LLM agents
              \item Standardized prompting and game state context provisioning
              \item Streamlined integration of LLMs, prompting architectures, and evaluation methods
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LLM Integration Capabilities:}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Support for cloud and locally-hosted LLMs
              \item Abstraction layers for seamless integration of any LLM
              \item High-level configuration options
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open-Source Compliance:}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Accessible and modifiable system with appropriate licensing for research purposes
              \item Comprehensive documentation
          \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
These are the requirements of the system we plan to achieve.
To prove its usability, we shall also implement the testing environment and prompting architecture as a proof of concept.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Accessible Game Environment:} A Minecraft-like 3D environment in Godot with sufficient complexity and intuitive interfaces for human researchers to monitor and evaluate agent performance
    \item \textbf{Structured Scenarios:} Diverse testing scenarios with automated performance scoring
    \item \textbf{Prompting Architecture:} Implement a prompting architecture emulating chain-of-thought and goal-based prompting systems with support for easy modification
\end{enumerate}

\section{Development}
\subsection{Environment Design}
A majority of early development focused on creating the agent's environment for qualitative evaluation.
Features included: procedural world generation with day/night cycle, navigation and A* pathfinding via Godot's Navigation3D system, suite of API functions for agent-environment interaction, NPC AI (animals, zombies) for objectives and adversaries, and item and inventory system.
After around 7 weeks, we had a functional environment sufficiently complex for our proof of concept.

    \caption{Agent-Environment Pipeline Architecture}
    \label{fig:agent-pipeline}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:agent-pipeline} illustrates our agent-environment pipeline architecture, which also serves as our prompting architecture.
Environmental information is fed directly into the LLM, which generates either a script to execute or a goal if no goal is currently set for the agent.
The generated script is executed by the environment, and the outcome is logged in the agent's "Memories," which updates the agent state, enabling persistent contextual awareness across iterations.

This memory system implements chain-of-thought reasoning, allowing the agent to build upon previous experiences and maintain contextual awareness across multiple decision cycles, which proved crucial for solving complex sequential tasks.

The available actions are API function calls that abstract away the low-level interaction logic of the environment.
This abstraction focuses the LLM on higher-level reasoning and decision making rather than implementation details.
For error handling, we implemented a robust system that catches broken or uncompilable code and can either re-prompt the LLM with the specific error for self-correction or count the iteration as a failure for benchmarking purposes.

Once the script is validated, the agent's "body" executes the actions sequentially until completion.
The pipeline then repeats, gathering updated environmental information and continuing until either the scenario goal is satisfied or the maximum allowed iterations is reached.

\section{Testing and Evaluation}
\subsection{Quantitative Testing}
We implemented several types of scenarios to test different aspects of agent capabilities:
\textbf{(1) Prompt adherence scenarios} test navigation and item manipulation to evaluate the agent's ability to correctly control their virtual body;
\textbf{(2) Entity interaction scenarios} assess the agent's ability to react to and interact with changes in real-time entity state;
\textbf{(3) Sequential reasoning tasks} evaluate the agent's ability to perform multi-step tasks requiring planning; and
\textbf{(4) Multi-agent tasks} test many-agent interaction in scenarios requiring collaboration or competition.

Our benchmarking toolkit automatically tracks performance metrics including success rate, completion time, and error recovery attempts for each scenario. 
We designed the system to detect and categorize failures, including code compilation errors that can potentially be repaired and timeouts where the agent fails to make progress within a reasonable timeframe.
Figure \ref{tab:model-performance} shows the performance of three different LLMs in our testing scenarios.


\subsection{Qualitative Testing}
Beyond quantitative metrics, we conducted qualitative evaluations to assess agent behavior in open-ended scenarios. Our observations revealed several notable patterns:
Our environment and prompting architecture designs translated well to the following qualitative observations, which we believe are important for future work in embodied AI:
\paragraph{Chain of Thought} When allowed to iteratively set goals and react to the results of their own actions, agents were able to succeed in more complex tasks.
\paragraph{Adaptability} By providing standardized context to the LLM in addition to a basic system prompt, we observed that most LLMs were capable of adapting to available information within environment and generating appropriate responses.
This was especially thanks to our Memory systems and context building solutions. For multimodal LLMs, this was particularly effective, as they were able to use visual information to inform their decisions.
This contextualization system allows environments, architectures, and LLMs to be easily tested by allowing for the passing of any required information. \answerTODO{this sucks}
\paragraph{Cooperative Behavior} In multi-agent scenarios, we observed emergent cooperative behaviors which would develop division-of-labor strategies when working toward common goals without explicit prompting. 
This emergent coordination suggests potential for more complex social dynamics in future iterations of the system, and for further evaluative research into the effectiveness of deployments of these types of systems in real-world applications.

\section{Significance}
\subsection{Trustworthy AI}
As embodied AI systems become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, establishing trust through rigorous evaluation becomes paramount.
SPEEN directly addresses this need by providing a simulation framework for testing and benchmarking LLMs in a controlled setting, enabling researchers and developers to assess the reliability and safety of their AI systems and architectures before deployment.
Our current product accomplishes this by providing the following: 

\textbf{(1) Reproducible Benchmarking:} Our open-source and easily modifiable environment allows for the extension of our system to new scenarios and architectures, enabling reproducible testing across different models and implementations.
This establishes a foundation for valid comparisons and trustworthy claims about model capabilities.

\textbf{(2) Simulated Testing:} By allowing researchers to test different prompting architectures and LLMs in a controlled, simulated environment, SPEEN enables the evaluation of prompting strategies, LLM performance, agent behavior, and the overall effectiveness of embodied AI systems before real-world deployment.

\textbf{(3) Standardized Metrics:} SPEEN provides a consistent set of environment examples that help evaluate the performance of embodied AI systems across multiple quantitative and/or qualitative dimensions, including planning, reasoning, task completion rate, adaptability, and cooperation.
These standardized metrics facilitate meaningful comparisons between different approaches and track progress in the field specific to embodied AI.

\subsection{Transitioning AI Research Into Production}
SPEEN bridges the gap between research and application of new AI technologies by introducing a standardized evaluation framework for the emerging field of embodied AI.
We believe it critical that AI systems undergo rigorous testing and evaluation before deployment, and SPEEN provides a platform for researchers to assess the performance and reliability of their models in a controlled environment.
As previously mentioned, we believe that allowing our systems to be extended to new architectures and models is critical to the success of our project as a benchmarking and testing framework.
We therefore place an emphasis on the clean documentation of our system and the extensibility of the different components that make up SPEEN, always keeping in mind the potential for our work to be further developed.
By providing these capabilities, SPEEN contributes to the responsible advancement of embodied AI from research concepts to practical applications, helping ensure that both our current systems and future systems are able to be used reliably, safely, and effectively.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
Large Language Models are a relatively new technology, with limited tools available for measuring their competency in decision-making and environment interaction, particularly in embodied contexts. While existing projects such as Mindcraft\footnote{kolbytn. (2023). GitHub - kolbytn/mindcraft. GitHub. \url{(https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft)}.} and Voyager integrate LLMs into virtual worlds, they lack comprehensive benchmarking features and require commercial licenses, creating barriers to research accessibility.

SPEEN addresses these limitations by providing an open-source, flexible framework for rigorous evaluation of embodied LLM agents. Our system's ability to seamlessly integrate different LLMs, coupled with standardized benchmarking scenarios designed to be easily modifiable, offers researchers a powerful tool for comparative analysis of embodied AI systems.

Future work will focus on three key areas: (1) expanding the range of testing scenarios to cover more diverse and challenging tasks, (2) developing more sophisticated multi-agent interactions to assess emergent social behaviors, and (3) refining evaluation metrics to better correlate with real-world application requirements. We also plan to develop environmental constraints that better approximate real-world deployments of embodied AI systems in robotics and beyond.

By making SPEEN available to the broader research community, we hope to accelerate progress in embodied AI by establishing common standards for evaluation and comparison, ultimately contributing to the development of more capable, reliable, and trustworthy embodied intelligence systems.

% citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous'' and include a copy of the anonymized paper in the supplementary material.

% \subsection{Footnotes}

% Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
% footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
% text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
% Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

% Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
% marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

% \subsection{Figures}

% \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm within}{0cm}}
%     \caption{Sample figure caption.}
% \end{figure}

% All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
% purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
% figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
% the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
% proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

% You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
% paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
% color.

% \subsection{Tables}

% All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
% title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
% table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
% numbered consecutively.

% Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
% strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
% typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
% \begin{center}
%     \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
% \end{center}
% This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

% \begin{table}
%     \caption{Sample table title}
%     \label{sample-table}
%     \centering
%     \begin{tabular}{lll}
%         \toprule
%         \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%         \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%         Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%         \midrule
%         Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%         Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%         Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%         \bottomrule
%     \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% \subsection{Math}
% Note that display math in bare TeX commands will not create correct line numbers for submission. Please use LaTeX (or AMSTeX) commands for unnumbered display math. (You really shouldn't be using \$\$ anyway; see \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to} and \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/40492/what-are-the-differences-between-align-equation-and-displaymath} for more information.)

% \subsection{Final instructions}

% Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
% particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
% fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
% \textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be

% \section*{NeurIPS Paper Checklist}

% %%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
% The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove the checklist: {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.} The checklist should follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material.  The checklist does NOT count towards the page
% limit.

% Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For each question in the checklist:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item You should answer \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item \answerNA{} means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the relevant information is Not Available.
%     \item Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).
%           % \item {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.}
% \end{itemize}

% {\bf The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.} They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published with the paper.

% The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "\answerYes{}" is generally preferable to "\answerNo{}", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "\answerNo{}" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "\answerNo{}" or "\answerNA{}" is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer \answerYes{} to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

% IMPORTANT, please:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item {\bf Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading ``NeurIPS Paper Checklist"},
%     \item  {\bf Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.}
%     \item {\bf Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers}.
% \end{itemize}


% %%% END INSTRUCTIONS %%%


% \begin{enumerate}

%     \item {\bf Claims}
%     \item[] Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
%               \item The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
%               \item The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
%               \item It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Limitations}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
%               \item The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
%               \item The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
%               \item The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
%               \item The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
%               \item The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
%               \item If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
%               \item While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Theory assumptions and proofs}
%     \item[] Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
%               \item All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
%               \item All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
%               \item The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
%               \item Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
%               \item Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Experimental result reproducibility}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%               \item If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
%               \item If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
%               \item Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
%               \item While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
%                     \begin{enumerate}
%                         \item If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
%                         \item If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
%                         \item If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
%                         \item We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
%                     \end{enumerate}
%           \end{itemize}


%     \item {\bf Open access to data and code}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
%               \item Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
%               \item While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
%               \item The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
%               \item The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
%               \item The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
%               \item At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
%               \item Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
%           \end{itemize}


%     \item {\bf Experimental setting/details}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%               \item The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
%               \item The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Experiment statistical significance}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%               \item The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
%               \item The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
%               \item The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
%               \item The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
%               \item It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
%               \item It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96\% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
%               \item For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
%               \item If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Experiments compute resources}
%     \item[] Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%               \item The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
%               \item The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
%               \item The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Code of ethics}
%     \item[] Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics \url{https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines}?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
%               \item If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
%               \item The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
%           \end{itemize}


%     \item {\bf Broader impacts}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
%               \item If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
%               \item Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
%               \item The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
%               \item The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
%               \item If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Safeguards}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
%               \item Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
%               \item Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
%               \item We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Licenses for existing assets}
%     \item[] Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
%               \item The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
%               \item The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
%               \item The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
%               \item For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
%               \item If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, \url{paperswithcode.com/datasets} has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
%               \item For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
%               \item If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
%           \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf New assets}
%     \item[] Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
